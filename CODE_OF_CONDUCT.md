Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the community
Showing empathy towards other community members
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also when an individual represents the project or its community in public spaces. Examples include:

Using an official project e-mail address
Posting via an official social media account
Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation as needed.

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to Fakemayham084 (ME) on Discord at fakemayham_0.8.4_.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated appropriately, with necessary and proportionate responses. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter's identity. Further enforcement policies may be outlined separately.

Project maintainers who fail to uphold or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences, as determined by other project leadership members.
